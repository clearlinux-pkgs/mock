Mock is used by the Fedora Build system to populate a chroot environment, which
is then used in building a source-RPM (SRPM). It can be used for long-term
management of a chroot environment, but generally a chroot is populated (using
DNF), an SRPM is built in the chroot to generate binary RPMs, and the chroot is
then discarded.
